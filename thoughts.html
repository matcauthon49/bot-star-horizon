                <h2>Snippets of Things I've been Thinking of at the Time</h2>
                <p>Making a new blog post is a time-consuming enterprise when you're running a self-hosted website, so this is a set of small, line- or paragraph-length ideas and thoughts I've been having that I think are worth noting down.</p>

                <h3>1 December, 2022.</h3>
                <p>I'm writing this after midnight, but I guess I had the thoughts pre-12PM.</p>
                <p>I watched a couple of new shows today: <em>Smallville</em> and <em>Futurama</em>. Both of them were highly enjoyable and I believe I'll continue watching them in the near future. I guess the reason I liked them was because they seemed really genuine with what they were presenting. Smallville doesn't seem like it's particularly afraid of being cringe (always a good thing), and while Futurama is somewhat cynical it's in the Gen-X-Y2K kinda way and not just the blatant ironic nihilism of Rick and Morty, or, dear God, Family Guy.</p>
                <p>TV seems to have come to an end, honestly. The lack of filler has had a notable impact on quality; it just seems like extended movies now, and you don't really get those episodes where the gang goes golfing or whatever. Filler is an integral part of long-form storytelling and the decreasing amounts of it along with shorter seasons loses the differentiator between TV and movies. They're different kinds of media.</p>
                <p>I also have something to say about the aesthetics of Futurama; it has that retrofuturistic style that was popular back in the 2000s. There's something very comforting about that aesthetic and its implications. The realization that the future isn't going to be radically better or worse, but about as shitty as today just in different ways seems liberating. I like the optimism that the mini-space age of the shuttles brought back. I wish we cared about space. The only way it'll ever come back into the popular consciousness at this point is if Elon Musk attempts to strip-mine a few asteroids.</p>
                <p>Also, <em>Motion Sickness</em> by Phoebe Bridgers is a great song.</p>

                <p>Some things just really are `local' events. Everybody knows about them when they happen, but they slowly fade away from public consciousness without making their way into pop culture of the era. I can think of two things that were the biggest things in the world when I was a kid, but I doubt most kids born today would be aware of them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The Indian Ocean Tsunami of 2004. I read about this in encyclopaedias all the time (I was unnaturally obsessed by natural disasters as a kid). There seemed to a be a big, international aid movement, and in an uncharacteristic fashion, countries around the world did pool their resources together to provide help for the people who were struck by it.</p>
                    <p>I remember that I used to know quite a bit of the details surrounding this catastrophe, but I was reminded of it today and realized I hadn't thought about for years. The only thing I vaguely remember is something about a catfish: a Japanese legend that attributed tsunamis to the gods holding down an evil catfish.</p>
                    <p>It seems like an interesting topic to look into. I'm sure people have done research about it, but the only reports I can find are governmental responses from 2004/05. Developing countries usually do not have historically well-established sudden-response and later research pipelines, so that might have contributed something to it.</p>
                    <p>I'm sure sesmiologists have something interesting to say about it.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Pluto being renamed a dwarf planet. This was huge. One of my only memories from 2006 is my mother waking me up in the morning and telling me that Pluto was no longer a planet. The concept of a dwarf planet didn't really register, and I felt bad for Clyde Tombaugh that his discovery wasn't as important anymore.</p>
                    <p>I remember it being all over textbooks in 2010 or so that Pluto is <em>not</em> a planet. I wonder if it's necessary to correct that misconception in 2022 (or 2023). No reason why today's kids (who were born after 2006) would ever have heard it.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>I don't think these events have permeated the popular culture landscape. Chernobyl wasn't forgotten, although the Tsunami was much worse -- politicization is probably the most powerful memory suppressor. Horrible phenomenon.</p>

                <img src="thoughts/Nov 2022/building.jpg" alt="Clouds Pass By" style="width:800px;" class="center">
                <p>I seem to have lost the ability to look at buildings while lying down and noticing the clouds passing by in a way that makes it seems like it's the clouds that's stationary, not the buildings. I remember being frightened by moving buildings as a kid and later trying to recreate the experience as a 12-year-old, knowing full well that it was just an illusion caused by the relative motion of clouds. I can't recall off the top of my head, but <em>some</em> teacher once gave that as an example of frames of motion.</p>
                <p>I think I mildly succeeded in it as a 12-year-old, but I was lying down at the perfect angle for the illusion to take hold today and was unable to adjust my frame of reference -- it seems like the clouds were moving too fast, or something. They vanished beyond my line of sight before I could fix them.</p>
