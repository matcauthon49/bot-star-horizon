        <h2>What is this Website?</h2>
        <p>
            This is a "blog." Such relics of the past no longer exist in the modern world, having been driven obsolete by distasteful, postmodernist (and self-funded) thinkpieces, 280-character text limits and GPT-3 generated media. To embrace our colonial robot overlords, the name of this website was also generated by the <a href="https://beta.openai.com/playground">Open-AI playground</a> when fed the input
        </p>
        <p><code>generate blog names based on the keywords cryptography, star trek, chess</code></p>
        <p>
            In other words, this website is the truest form of artistic and cultural expression known to man: markdown and raw HTML, unread by all.

        <h2>What do you write about?</h2>
        <p>
            A lot of stuff, actually. A comprehensive list of topics would be difficult to come up with, because it's largely whimsical musings on a topic-of-the-month along with the ocassional short story. I like to think of this as a personal diary. Because that's what it is, fundamentally -- some of these posts are likely to be ridiculously tiny, perhaps one-liners or Fellini quotes indicating what I felt like on, say, the 22nd of May 2023 (god forbid I have one of those time-travelling emails on the way to that date, because I probably do). That said, I suppose the general flavor of this website can probably be distilled down to at least half, if not all of the following subjects:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>cryptography</li>
            <li>computer science, mostly limited to algorithms and complexity</li>
            <li>math, mostly limited to combinatorics</li>
            <li>astronomy</li>
            <li>cosmology, or quantum mechanics, or the nebulous term known as theoretical physics</li>
            <li>critiques of modern culture</li>
            <li>critiques of modern <em>consumerist</em> culture</li>
            <li>chess</li>
            <li><em>Star Trek</em></li>
            <li><em>Dazed and Confused</em></li>
            <li>cinema in general, especially in the naturalist sense</li>
            <li>Raymond Carver short stories</li>
            <li>musings on history</li>
            <li>capitalism, ironically</li>
            <li>noise rock</li>
            <li>collectibles</li>
            <li>obscure books (and other media)</li>
            <li>old children's TV shows</li>
            <li>board games</li>
            <li>fairy tales</li>
            <li>an inability to love nature as much as it deserves</li>
            <li>the great barrier reef</li>
            <li>existential philosophy of the 101 kind</li>
            <li>shaolin shadowboxing, and the wu-tang sword style</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The above list was largely unplanned, and is probably still inaccurate.
