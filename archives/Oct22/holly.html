        <h2>Holly Golightly, Boring People and "Music"</h2>
        <p class="date">October 14, 2022</p>

        <h3>Holly Golightly</h3>

        <p>Audrey Hepburn is one of those people who's supposed to be 'canonically' attractive, and after watching <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em>, I concur -- she's ditzy, cute, impeccably dressed, and just has that undescribable quality on screen that elevates even an otherwise mediocre performance to a total classic. She's like Grace Kelly, though with a different, more modern aura. It's a pity the movie wasn't too good. Audrey herself makes it watchable.</p>

        <p>I've been wanting to read <em>In Cold Blood</em> for a while now, but after watching this movie I'll probably put it off. I really hope this isn't representative of Truman Capote's work, because the dialogue was really lacking and the plot was just all over the place with a remarkably poor flow. Maybe I'll read <em>Helter Skelter</em> now. I'm aware that being too fascinated by the Manson Murders is a red flag, humanwise, but there's something very intriguing about the man and his god-like influence over the members of his cult; I recall <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9QXY80OxS0">this clip</a>, where his behaviour is so devilish that it's impossible to believe that it's not premeditated.</p>

        <div class="blue-box">
            <center><h3>Helter Skelter</h3></center>
            <p><em>Helter Skelter</em> is the biggest-selling true crime book of all time, named after the Beatles' song off the White Album (which in itself is named after a British children's playground ride akin to a merry-go-round). It deals with the Manson Murders, and the title refers to Manson's belief that the Beatles were attempting to communicate information about an upcoming race war named after the song, which he attempted to incite with the murders.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Ted Kaczynski is another one of those extremists in prison, although he's more intelligent and, on the whole, more dangerous. I wonder if he has his own Holly Golightlys to go visit him.</p>

        <h3>Progressive Metal</h3>
        <p>As of today, these are my 10 favorite albums:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>Daydream Nation</em> by Sonic Youth</li>
            <li><em>Let it Be</em> by The Replacements</li>
            <li><em>Painful</em> by Yo La Tengo</li>
            <li><em>Loveless</em> by My Bloody Valentine</li>
            <li><em>Revolver</em> by The Beatles</li>
            <li><em>Emotion</em> by Carly Rae Jepsen</li>
            <li><em>Twin Fantasy</em> by Car Seat Headrest</li>
            <li><em>Is this it</em> by The Strokes</li>
            <li><em>Talking Heads '77</em> by Talking Heads</li>
            <li><em>Kid A</em> by Radiohead</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Notice the startling omission of progressive metal. People really like that stuff: Tool is the one I'm most familiar with, but they all seem to be heavier Dream Theater clones. I don't know, music without narrative context does not do anything to me; <em>The Fool</em> off In the Aeroplane over the Sea is an excellent instrumental, but it only means something in the Anne Frank lament. I appreciate that people appreciate jazz (and I do like a lot of it) but progressive jazz which supposedly has more artistic value due to musical complexity just seems like a scam to me. You don't need music theory to appreciate music. <em>Yesterday</em> is just Paul with a guitar.</p>

        <h3>A Boring Conversation</h3>

        <p>I had a highly dull conversation today about whether everything is art. The other guy kept going on with some sort of physical definition of art -- any manipulation of the physical laws of nature, apparently, which means that literally everything except the Platonic ideals. He kept asking me to come up with fringe cases which he could iron out in order to maintain consistency. Was quite unimpressed by the end, especially by his insistence that thoughts concretize things by turning them into chemical reactions in the brain.</p>

        <h3>Parties</h3>

        <p>Mom made good food today, which I couldn't eat (due to not being at home). They're having a Diwali party in uni. Can't attend cause I have to give my GRE. Sucks.</p>
