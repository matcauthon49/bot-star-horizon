        <h2>Nobody Knows Anything about Anything</h2>
        <p class="date">October 11, 2022</p>

        <p>I've read three papers over the past week.</p>
        <p>There used to be a time when I considered papers to be sacred documents -- culminations of esoteric ideas brought together into a cohesive whole, decorated around the sides with strokes of genius. Majestic, the product of years of effort, and utterly incomprehensible to undergrads bar Terence Tao. I would waddle through the webpages of famous mathematicians and read the abstracts in an attempt to at least experience those words which would, at some unspecified date far into the future, become objects I would be able to treat with the respect they deserved. (In math, I suppose that's not entirely incorrect. Some of those terms -- `sheaf,' for example -- really <em>do</em> appear to require swathes of time to understand and truly be familiar with. There's a course being offered this semester called GIT and Moduli Theory, and I doubt it'll be much of a jab to say that you need to spend a semester to even get <a href="https://userpage.fu-berlin.de/hoskins/M15_Lecture_notes.pdf">the name of that course</a>.)</p>
        <p>This is not what I would commonly call a misconception, since it does seem like mathematical papers are rigorous and generally inacessible to people outside any particular field. In truth, this may or may not be true. <em>I</em> can get a lot of enumerative combinatorics and graph theory, and I am assured that both number theory and commutative algebra papers are readable to the man who attempts to put in the effort. I mean, Erdos did something, after all. It's the stereotypically deep fields -- algebraic topology, for instance, especially when you get in the thick of higher homotopies or K-theory or whatever simplicial substructure they're attempting to manufacture these days -- that the <em>vagueness</em> begins to set in. This isn't easy. This is for <em>the pros</em>. The media does a great job at propogating this image, as by math popularizers' coverage of Fermat's Last Theorem.</p>

        <div class="blue-box">
            <center><h3>Fermat's Last Theorem</h3></center>
            <p>Fermat's Last Theorem is the mathematician's version of a fairy tale. It's a nice story that has all the epic pieces: the prophecy, the quest, and the inevitable payoff in the form of a Abel Prize. Long story short: Pierre de Fermat was a mathematician in the 17th century who, in the margin of Diophantus's <em>Arithmetica</em>, conjectured that</p>
            <p>$$a^n+b^n=c^n$$</p>
            <p>had no solutions for \(n>2\). This turned out to be <a href="https://people.math.wisc.edu/~boston/869.pdf">true, but really, really hard.</a> The proof was given by Andrew Wiles, after he worked on it for about six years in secrecy. His ideas were delivered at a conference in 1993 where he offhandedly remarked at the end that his result implies Fermat's Last Theorem. While the paper itself seems completely indecipherable to me, the major steps involve representing elliptic curves as Galois representations, prove something about the modularity of these curves, and then show using a contradiction that FLT implies curves which violate such properties.</p>
            <p>FLT is really cool because it's easy to show to non-mathematicians, and to someone who knows little math in the true sense but quite a bit more math than the average person, it seems both impressive and interesting. Add "proof of FLT" to my list of things I want to learn, alongside Algorithmic Game Theory, enumerative combinatorics, and Vakil.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Unfortunately, computer science is not like that.</p>
        <p>Consider cryptography. Genealogically, crypto dates back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Blum">Manuel Blum</a>, whose students -- Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and, to a lesser extent, the Vazhiranis -- are responsible for about 50% of the stuff that pure cryptographers do. The other 50% is a wide variety of generally awesome but less immediately flashy people.</p>
