        <h2>Nobody Knows Anything about Anything</h2>
        <p class="date">October 11, 2022</p>

        <p>I've read three papers over the past week.</p>
        <p>There used to be a time when I considered papers to be sacred documents -- culminations of esoteric ideas brought together into a cohesive whole, decorated around the sides with strokes of genius. Majestic, the product of years of effort, and utterly incomprehensible to undergrads bar Terence Tao. I would waddle through the webpages of famous mathematicians and read the abstracts in an attempt to at least experience those words which would, at some unspecified date far into the future, become objects I would be able to treat with the respect they deserved. (In math, I suppose that's not entirely incorrect. Some of those terms -- `sheaf,' for example -- really <em>do</em> appear to require swathes of time to understand and truly be familiar with. There's a course being offered this semester called GIT and Moduli Theory, and I doubt it'll be much of a jab to say that you need to complete an entire course to even get the name of that course.)</p>
