        <h2>Nobody Knows Anything about Anything</h2>
        <p class="date">October 11, 2022</p>

        <p>I've read three papers over the past week.</p>
        <p>There used to be a time when I considered papers to be sacred documents -- culminations of esoteric ideas brought together into a cohesive whole, decorated around the sides with strokes of genius. Majestic, the product of years of effort, and utterly incomprehensible to undergrads bar Terence Tao. I would waddle through the webpages of famous mathematicians and read the abstracts in an attempt to at least experience those words which would, at some unspecified date far into the future, become objects I would be able to treat with the respect they deserved. (In math, I suppose that's not entirely incorrect. Some of those terms -- `sheaf,' for example -- really <em>do</em> appear to require swathes of time to understand and truly be familiar with. There's a course being offered this semester called GIT and Moduli Theory, and I doubt it'll be much of a jab to say that you need to spend a semester to even get <a href="https://userpage.fu-berlin.de/hoskins/M15_Lecture_notes.pdf">the name of that course</a>.)</p>
        <p>This is not what I would commonly call a misconception, since it does seem like mathematical papers are rigorous and generally inacessible to people outside any particular field. In truth, this may or may not be true. <em>I</em> can get a lot of enumerative combinatorics and graph theory, and I am assured that both number theory and commutative algebra papers are readable to the man who attempts to put in the effort. I mean, Erdos did something, after all. It's the stereotypically deep fields -- algebraic topology, for instance, especially when you get in the thick of higher homotopies or K-theory or whatever simplicial substructure they're attempting to manufacture these days -- that the <em>vagueness</em> begins to set in. This isn't easy. This is for <em>the pros</em>. The media does a great job at propogating this image, as by math popularizers' coverage of Fermat's Last Theorem.</p>
