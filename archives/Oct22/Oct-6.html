        <h2>Hardness Amplification with ECCs</h2>
        <p>Apparently you can transform worst-case hard functions into average-case hard functions. The definitions are a bit wonky, and I'm still not sure what's the point in \(1-\delta\) error rather than plain and simple \(\frac{1}{2}\pm\delta\) error -- I suppose it makes working with the whole thing easier, but then you're really beating around the bush with the whole `hardness' thing. It's not a matter of what works -- I mean, clearly, this is nitpicking, and I'm probably coming off as an idiot saying this -- but it's a matter of what makes sense <em>cryptographically</em>, and the course I'm taking is supposed to be a complexity course, but who knows.</p>
        <p>Still haven't done my homework. I've told him I'll submit it tomorrow, but at this point I really doubt whether I'm going to submit it tomorrow. I'll submit it <em>sometime</em>, sure -- sometime when I get the answer out of thin air, because I'm not wanting to expend any effort into this course when I could be putting more effort into MPC (which I am currently procrastinating on).</p>
        <p>But the idea is pretty neat. Take a function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, encode its truth table as some code $\hat{f}\subseteq\Sigma^{\hat{n}}$, and it follows that the truth table of any $\delta$-distance circuit is going to be <em>decoded</em> back to give you $f$. It's pretty clever, although it requires some sort of probabilistic decoding mechanism which requires query access to any evaluation of your circuit, so that's where the circuit time/space bound $t$ or $s$ come in. It works for Reed-Marshall codes (because of course it works for Reed-Marshall codes). I only wish the algorithm was deterministic, however.</p>
        <p>Still can't get over the fact that they think $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{BPP}$. The fact that randomness confers no additional power seems absurd.</p>

        <h3>Key-Homomorphic PRFs</h3>
        <p>I want a PRF that can do this efficiently:</p>
        <p>$$f(\mathcal{P}(g, x), \mathcal{P}(a, x)) = \mathcal{P}(g^a, x)$$</p>
        <p>Seems like it'd be the holy grail of homomrphic PRFs.</p>

        <h3>Goodfellas</h3>
        <p>Against my better judgement, I am watching Goodfellas. Should be studying, really, or sending out emails or something. Not sitting and watching goddamn Goodfellas. Ah, well.</p>
